pebble-analytics
================

Google Analytics implementation for Pebble smartwatch. Supports screen and event tracking. It uses the Google Analytics [Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/devguide#apptracking). Your Analytics property has to be a Mobile App Propery to work with this.

## Usage

This project could be used as a demo of on the watch. Just download it, change the Analytics ID in pebble-js-app.js with your own, build and install. Whenn you press the UP, DOWN and SELECT buttons, you should see Events in your Google Analytics realtime view.

If you want to use it in your own project, take the following steps:

###On the JS side

First copy contents of __pebble-ga.js__ to the beginning of __pebble-js-app.js__

Then initialize an analytics object like this:

    var ga = new Analytics('UA-1234567-0', 'myApp', '1.0.0');

Track events or screen with like this:

    ga.trackScreen('screen name');
    ga.trackEvent('category', 'action');

###On the C side

Copy ga.h and ga.c to your src/ folder and include ga.h in your primary app file. Then set up app messages by calling __app_message_open()__.

You can then track stuff like this:

    trackScreen("screen name");
    trackEvent("category", "action");
    
Keep in mind that you are responsible of handling messages. If you track to many times in a short interval on the watch, the messages could get lost. I recommend implementing some sort of message queue.
